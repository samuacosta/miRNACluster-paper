	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Altogether, understanding integrative and co-operative activities in gene regulation is conjugated with identification of miRNA families. In current applications, the identification of such groups of miRNAs is only investigated by the projections of their expression patterns and so along with their functional relations. Considering the fact that the miRNA regulation is mediated through its mature sequence by the recognition of the target mRNA sequences in the RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) binding regions, we argue here that relevant miRNA groups can be obtained by de novo clustering them solely based on their sequence information, by a sequence clustering approach. In this way, a new study can be guided by a set of previously annotated miRNA groups without any preliminary experimentation or literature evidence. In this report, we presents the results of a computational study that considers only mature miRNA sequences to obtain relevant miRNA clusters using various machine learning methods employed with different sequence representation schemes. Both statistical and biological evaluations encourages the use this approach in silico assessment of functional miRNA groups.},

	abstract = {AIMS: The many miRNAs discovered so far have been divided into biologically representative families, aiming at organizing and systematizing their study so to promote, mainly, a better understanding of their functionalities. Clustering miRNA sequences can corroborate the family-based organizations as well as helping to explore sequences belonging to the same cluster as potentially having similar biological functions.
OBSERVATIONS: Considering that members of the same miRNA family tend to biologically function in similar ways, a well-structured family can help detecting miRNA functions which have not been associated yet with any existing family.
METHODS: The work described in this paper empirically investigates the suitability of organizing miRNAs as families, using a clustering algorithm based on a particular type of graph i.e., minimal spanning tree (MST), for clustering miRNA sequences. Seven miRNA families stored in the online miRBase database have been used as input to the MST-based clustering algorithm and clustering results have been compared to assess the suitability of identirying them.
RESULTS: The motivations for the experiments were to identify refinements in miRNA family organizations that could be pursued and, also, investigate how the chosen graph-based clustering algorithm would perform in miRNA related domains.
CONCLUSION: Interesting and useful results, particularly related to detecting information based on the visualization of the final induced graphs, and their induced connected components (clusters), are presented and discussed. Particularly, experiments results suggested the possibility of refining some miRNA families by grouping some of their miRNAs as sub-families.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-13-S8-S15},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since the initial annotation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in 2001, many studies have sought to identify additional miRNAs experimentally or computationally in various species. MiRNAs act with the Argonaut family of proteins to regulate target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) post-transcriptionally. Currently, researches mainly focus on single miRNA function study. Considering that members in the same miRNA family might participate in the same pathway or regulate the same target(s) and thus share similar biological functions, people can explore useful knowledge from high quality miRNA family architecture.
RESULTS: In this article, we developed an unsupervised clustering-based method miRCluster to automatically group miRNAs. In order to evaluate this method, several data sets were constructed from the online database miRBase. Results showed that miRCluster can efficiently arrange miRNAs (e.g identify 354 families in miRBase16 with an accuracy of 92.08\%, and can recognize 9 of all 10 newly-added families in miRBase 17). By far, {\textasciitilde}30\% mature miRNAs registered in miRBase are unclassified. With miRCluster, over 85\% unclassified miRNAs can be assigned to certain families, while {\textasciitilde}44\% of these miRNAs distributed in {\textasciitilde}300novel families.
CONCLUSIONS: In short, miRCluster is an automatic and efficient miRNA family identification method, which does not require any prior knowledge. It can be helpful in real use, especially when exploring functions of novel miRNAs. All relevant materials could be freely accessed online (http://admis.fudan.edu.cn/projects/miRCluster).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are {\textasciitilde}22 nt long integral elements responsible for post-transcriptional control of gene expressions. After the identification of thousands of miRNAs, the challenge is now to explore their specific biological functions. To this end, it will be greatly helpful to construct a reasonable organization of these miRNAs according to their homologous relationships. Given an established miRNA family system (e.g. the miRBase family organization), this paper addresses the problem of automatically and accurately classifying newly found miRNAs to their corresponding families by supervised learning techniques. Concretely, we propose an effective method, miRFam, which uses only primary information of pre-miRNAs or mature miRNAs and a multiclass SVM, to automatically classify miRNA genes.
RESULTS: An existing miRNA family system prepared by miRBase was downloaded online. We first employed n-grams to extract features from known precursor sequences, and then trained a multiclass SVM classifier to classify new miRNAs (i.e. their families are unknown). Comparing with miRBase's sequence alignment and manual modification, our study shows that the application of machine learning techniques to miRNA family classification is a general and more effective approach. When the testing dataset contains more than 300 families (each of which holds no less than 5 members), the classification accuracy is around 98\%. Even with the entire miRBase15 (1056 families and more than 650 of them hold less than 5 samples), the accuracy surprisingly reaches 90\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on experimental results, we argue that miRFam is suitable for application as an automated method of family classification, and it is an important supplementary tool to the existing alignment-based small non-coding RNA (sncRNA) classification methods, since it only requires primary sequence information.

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNAs that pair to sites in mRNAs to direct post-transcriptional repression. Many sites that match the miRNA seed (nucleotides 2–7), particularly those in 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs), are preferentially conserved. Here, we overhauled our tool for finding preferential conservation of sequence motifs and applied it to the analysis of human 3′UTRs, increasing by nearly threefold the detected number of preferentially conserved miRNA target sites. The new tool more efficiently incorporates new genomes and more completely controls for background conservation by accounting for mutational biases, dinucleotide conservation rates, and the conservation rates of individual UTRs. The improved background model enabled preferential conservation of a new site type, the “offset 6mer,” to be detected. In total, {\textgreater}45,000 miRNA target sites within human 3′UTRs are conserved above background levels, and {\textgreater}60\% of human protein-coding genes have been under selective pressure to maintain pairing to miRNAs. Mammalian-specific miRNAs have far fewer conserved targets than do the more broadly conserved miRNAs, even when considering only more recently emerged targets. Although pairing to the 3′ end of miRNAs can compensate for seed mismatches, this class of sites constitutes less than 2\% of all preferentially conserved sites detected. The new tool enables statistically powerful analysis of individual miRNA target sites, with the probability of preferentially conserved targeting (PCT) correlating with experimental measurements of repression. Our expanded set of target predictions (including conserved 3′-compensatory sites), are available at the TargetScan website, which displays the PCT for each site and each predicted target.},

These methods are starting to become a bottleneck in some analysis pipelines when faced with data sets of the size of many thousands of sequences. Some methods allow computation of larger data sets while sacrificing quality, and others produce high-quality alignments, but scale badly with the number of sequences. In this paper, we describe a new program called Clustal Omega, which can align virtually any number of protein sequences quickly and that delivers accurate alignments. The accuracy of the package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high-quality aligners. On larger data sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in terms of execution time and quality. Clustal Omega also has powerful features for adding sequences to and exploiting information in existing alignments, making use of the vast amount of precomputed information in public databases like Pfam.},

Protein family classification can significantly contribute to the delineation of functional diversity of homologous proteins, the prediction of function based on domain architecture or the presence of sequence motifs as well as comparative genomics, providing valuable evolutionary insights. We present a novel approach called TRIBE-MCL for rapid and accurate clustering of protein sequences into families. The method relies on the Markov cluster (MCL) algorithm for the assignment of proteins into families based on precomputed sequence similarity information. This novel approach does not suffer from the problems that normally hinder other protein sequence clustering algorithms, such as the presence of multi-domain proteins, promiscuous domains and fragmented proteins. The method has been rigorously tested and validated on a number of very large databases, including SwissProt, InterPro, SCOP and the draft human genome. Our results indicate that the method is ideally suited to the rapid and accurate detection of protein families on a large scale. The method has been used to detect and categorise protein families within the draft human genome and the resulting families have been used to annotate a large proportion of human proteins.},

However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from corresponding partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addition to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between ±1.},

	abstract = {Record linkage is the process of identifying and linking records about the same entities from one or more databases. Record linkage can be viewed as a classification problem where the aim is to decide whether a pair of records is a match (i.e. two records refer to the same real-world entity) or a non-match (two records refer to two different entities). Various classification techniques—including supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised and active learning based—have been employed for record linkage. If ground truth data in the form of known true matches and non-matches are available, the quality of classified links can be evaluated. Due to the generally high class imbalance in record linkage problems, standard accuracy or misclassification rate are not meaningful for assessing the quality of a set of linked records. Instead, precision and recall, as commonly used in information retrieval and machine learning, are used. These are often combined into the popular F-measure, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. We show that the F-measure can also be expressed as a weighted sum of precision and recall, with weights which depend on the linkage method being used. This reformulation reveals that the F-measure has a major conceptual weakness: the relative importance assigned to precision and recall should be an aspect of the problem and the researcher or user, but not of the particular linkage method being used. We suggest alternative measures which do not suffer from this fundamental flaw.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that recognize and bind to partially complementary sites in the 3' untranslated regions of target genes in animals and, by unknown mechanisms, regulate protein production of the target transcript. Different combinations of microRNAs are expressed in different cell types and may coordinately regulate cell-specific target genes. Here, we present PicTar, a computational method for identifying common targets of microRNAs. Statistical tests using genome-wide alignments of eight vertebrate genomes, PicTar's ability to specifically recover published microRNA targets, and experimental validation of seven predicted targets suggest that PicTar has an excellent success rate in predicting targets for single microRNAs and for combinations of microRNAs. We find that vertebrate microRNAs target, on average, roughly 200 transcripts each. Furthermore, our results suggest widespread coordinate control executed by microRNAs. In particular, we experimentally validate common regulation of Mtpn by miR-375, miR-124 and let-7b and thus provide evidence for coordinate microRNA control in mammals.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute an important class of small regulatory RNAs that are derived from distinct hairpin precursors (pre-miRNAs). In contrast to mature miRNAs, which have been characterized in numerous genome-wide studies of different organisms, research on global profiling of pre-miRNAs is limited. Here, using massive parallel sequencing, we have performed global characterization of both mouse mature and precursor miRNAs. In total, 87 369 704 and 252 003 sequencing reads derived from 887 mature and 281 precursor miRNAs were obtained, respectively. Our analysis revealed new aspects of miRNA/pre-miRNA processing and modification, including eight Ago2-cleaved pre-miRNAs, eight new instances of miRNA editing and exclusively 5′ tailed mirtrons. Furthermore, based on the sequences of both mature and precursor miRNAs, we developed a miRNA discovery pipeline, miRGrep, which does not rely on the availability of genome reference sequences. In addition to 239 known mouse pre-miRNAs, miRGrep predicted 41 novel ones with high confidence. Similar as known ones, the mature miRNAs derived from most of these novel loci showed both reduced abundance following Dicer knockdown and the binding with Argonaute2. Evaluation on data sets obtained from Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis sp.11 demonstrated that miRGrep could be widely used for miRNA discovery in metazoans, especially in those without genome reference sequences.},
